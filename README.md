# Responsive Hamburger Menu With Flexbox

This component contains all of the working code for an animated and responsive hamburger menu. The menu is functional without any JavaScript, though some is used to hide and show the menu while scrolling. The original styling was done using scss and can be located in the src folder, or the ready to go css file can be located in the dist folder.

## Getting Started

Move all content within the `<nav>` tags to the desired location. All styles starting with header or .top-nav are for the function and styling of the menu and should be added and linked to your document.

### Prerequisites

No additional software or tools are required unless you are using the src files, in which case you will need a sass compiler.
